# BackApp
BackApp is a Go + React application that lets automatically schedule and inspect backups of remote servers via SSH.

It is a very lightweight server (~50 MB) that runs locally (or on a dedicated machine) and provides a web interface to manage backup profiles.

## Features
- Add multiple remote servers via SSH using password or key authentication.
- Create storage locations and naming rules for backups.
- Storage locations are the place on your local machine where backups are stored.
- Naming rules define what the folder with the backups will be called.
- Create backup profiles using a flexible template engine or create one from scratch.
- Each profile can have pre- and post-backup commands that run on the remote server before and after the backup.
- You can define file rules to include/exclude specific paths in the backup.
- View detailed logs of each backup run, including success/failure status and output of commands.
- Schedule backups using cron expressions.
- Simple and intuitive web interface built with React and Material-UI.
- Deleting backups, backup profiles, and servers with confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions.

## Configuration

BackApp supports the following command-line flags:

- `-port` - Port to run the server on (default: `8080`)
- `-db` - SQLite database path (default: `/data/app.db`)

Examples:
```bash
# Run on a different port
./backapp -port=9090

# Use a custom database location
./backapp -db=/custom/path/app.db

# Combine multiple flags
./backapp -port=9090 -db=/custom/path/app.db
```

## Quick start

### Native binary (recommended for smaller setups)
- Download the latest release for your platform.

- Run the binary, then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
In case 8080 is in use, set a different port with `-port=9090`.

### Using Docker or Docker Compose
- Pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry:
  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/dennis960/backapp:latest
  ```
- Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to run BackApp with Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

## Build from source
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.24+) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Clone this repository.
- After installing the npm dependencies, build the frontend:
  ```bash
  cd web
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- A static bundle will be created in `server/static`.
- Now build the backend:
  ```bash
  cd ../server
  go build -o backapp
  ```
- Run the server:
  ```bash
  ./backapp -port=8080
  ```

## Not supported

- Incremental backups
- Backup deduplication
- Restoring from backups
